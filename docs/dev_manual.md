# Developer Manual

## Building

This is a normal Rust application.

    git clone <...>
    cd docdustry
    cargo build
    target/debug/docdustry

## Requirements

As a developer,
you should know the requirements.

```docdustry-doclist
only-if-tagged: requirement
```

Including them is also possible, for long documents.

![include](did:requirements)

That's it.

```docdustry-docmeta
id: dev_manual
tag: todo
```
