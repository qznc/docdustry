# DocDustry shall support inclusion

One file can include another one.
Thus, we can keep files short and still build large documents.

Simplest way is an img link to a document id:

    ![include](did:foobar)

Further ideas would be collections via tags...

```docdustry-docmeta
id: req2
status: accepted
tag: requirement
```
